# Project Skeleton For Tufts CS Code For Good

Feel free to fork this/copy it for other projects that may find it useful.

What this gives you out of the box:
* Only need to install ONE piece of software onto your computer (not including your editor of choice)
    * Don't have to worry about Python version, Postgres version, etc etc
* A Python backend running Flask (a fairly straightforward Python web framework https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* Stand up a Postgres database with one command
* Start up the server with one command
* Pre-configured to static files (JS, CSS, images, etc.) from `/static/`
* Serves index.html at `/`
